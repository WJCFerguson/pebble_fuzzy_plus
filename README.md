# pebble_fuzzy_plus
Fuzzy Time watch face for the Pebble watch, showing details when shaken.

Shows the time to the nearest quarter hour, with some indication when it's far from the quarter.  Then, when shaken/tapped, shows the date and digital time at the bottom.  I found I liked fuzzy time faces, but sometimes I just needed to know exactly the time, and didn't want to switch to another face.

Sorry, no user settings - at present you'd have to edit the source to change anything.

In the future, the detail may be cyclable to more info, like weather.
